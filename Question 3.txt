### Q3. What is the same-origin policy in the context of AJAX requests, and how can you work around it?

Same-Origin Policy is a security measure implemented by browsers to prevent malicious scripts on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model (DOM). 

Workarounds:
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): The server can include CORS headers in its response to permit the browser to allow resources to be accessed from another origin.
- JSONP (JSON with Padding): This technique involves using script tags to request a resource that returns a JavaScript function call with the data as an argument.
- Proxy Server: Use a server-side proxy to make the request to the target server and then return the response to the client.
